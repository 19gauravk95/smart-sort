# smart-sort
Smart Sort is an Hybrid, Intelligent, Adaptive and efficient sorting algorithm that tries to utilize the best of sorting algorithm like Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Quick Sort, Counting Sort and Merge Sort

This project consists of a visualizer that shows and compares whats the execution time of the smart-sort when compared to other algorithms.

Usually its 10x or more faster than other major algorithms.

You can find the main algorithm-smartsort in SortingAlgorithm/Primitive/SmartSort.java

Usage :
SmartSort s = new SmartSort(#array here#);
s.sort();

Efficiency can be improved by improving the algorithm.
