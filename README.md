# Smart Sort - A Hybrid Sort Algorithm
**Smart Sort** is a Hybrid, Intelligent, Adaptive and efficient sorting algorithm that tries to utilize the best of sorting algorithm like Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Quick Sort, Counting Sort and Merge Sort

This project consists of a visualizer that shows and compares whats the execution time of the smart-sort when compared to other algorithms.

Usually, **10x - 50x** faster than other major algorithms.

You can find the main algorithm - smartsort in **SortingAlgorithm/Primitive/SmartSort.java**

## Usage :
```
SmartSort s = new SmartSort(<array here>);
s.sort();
```
